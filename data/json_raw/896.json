Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.",

A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. It appears to decrease the time to fall asleep in children with developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation. It may also improve secondary insomnia associated with various sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Other possible uses for which there is some evidence for include: benzodiazepine withdrawal, cluster headache, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), primary insomnia, jet lag, nicotine withdrawal, preoperative anxiety and sedation, prostate cancer, solid tumors (when combined with IL-2 therapy in certain cancers), sunburn prevention (topical use), tardive dyskinesia, thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, chemotherapy and other disorders.",

At base line, the subjects had free-running circadian rhythms with distinct and predictable cycles averaging 24.5 hours (range, 24.2 to 24.9). These rhythms were unaffected by the administration of placebo. In six of the seven subjects the rhythm was entrained to a 24.0-hour cycle during melatonin treatment (P<0.001). After entrainment, the subjects spent less time awake after the initial onset of sleep (P=0.05) and the efficiency of sleep was higher (P=0.06). Three subjects subsequently participated in a trial in which a 10-mg dose of melatonin was given daily until entrainment was achieved. The dose was then reduced to 0.5 mg per day over a period of three months; the entrainment persisted, even at the lowest dose...",

Obesity and the associated health problems urgently require effective strategies of treatment. The new discovery that a substantial amount of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) is retained in adult humans provides a potential target for treatment of human obesity. BAT is active metabolically and disposes of extra energy via generation of heat through uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. The physiology of BAT is readily regulated by melatonin, which not only increases recruitment of brown adipocytes but also elevates their metabolic activity in mammals. It is speculated that the hypertrophic effect and functional activation of BAT induced by melatonin may likely apply to the human. Thus, melatonin, a naturally occurring substance with no reported toxicity, may serve as a novel approach for treatment of obesity. Conversely, because of the availability of artificial light sources, excessive light exposure after darkness onset in modern societies should be considered a potential contributory factor to human obesity as light at night dramatically reduces endogenous melatonin production. In the current article, the potential associations of melatonin, BAT, obesity and the medical implications are discussed.",

The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. It helps regulate sleep-wake cycles or the circadian rhythm. Production of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. High levels of melatonin induce sleep and so consumption of the drug can be used to combat insomnia and jet lag. MT1 and MT2 receptors may be a target for the treatment of circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions",

A pilot study of 3 adult males showed dose linearity, absence of saturation kinetics, and unaltered metabolism and urinary excretion for doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0 ug/kg. All other subjects received 0.5 ug/kg melatonin. The results of pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from serum melatonin showed no significant gender differences in adults. However, developmental differences were significant between prepubertal children and adults for terminal elimination rate constant (1.08 +/- 0.25 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.11 per hr), elimination half-life (0.67 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.10 hr), and area under the concentration-time curve (250.9 +/- 91.8 vs. 376.9 +/- 154.3 (pg/mL)hr, respectively). At all time points melatonin levels were higher in serum than in saliva, and the ratio between serum and salivary melatonin varied up to 55-fold within and between individuals. Results based on salivary melatonin showed significant differences between prepubertal children and adults for the terminal elimination rate constant (1.90 +/- 0.95 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.28 per hr). The described group differences in pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that prepubertal children metabolize melatonin faster than adults. The inconsistent ratio between serum and salivary melatonin calls for caution in the use of salivary melatonin for pharmacokinetic studies or to infer pineal function. The present findings, suggestive of faster melatonin metabolism in prepubertal children, combined with the known decline of serum melatonin with age and higher excretion rate of the metabolite in prepubertal children lead us to conclude that the prepubertal pineal gland has a higher melatonin secretion rate than the adult gland.",

In addition, a pinealomectomized patient whose nocturnal plasma melatonin had been abolished was investigated after the i.v. infusion--once during the night and once during the day. The clearance of melatonin from blood showed a biexponential decay. The pharmacokinetic parameters in the two studies were similar, except for the disappearance rate constant beta and the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss). Supplementary peaks or troughs were superimposed on the plateau and the falling part of the profile. They were not due to stimulation of endogenous secretion, because they were also seen in the pinealomectomized patient. During the melatonin infusion, the plasma hormone level reached a steady-state after 60 and 120 min, and when it was equal to the nocturnal level.",

In a randomized and double-blind controlled study 10 healthy male subjects undertook an 80 min intensive hypertrophic heavy resistance exercise session (RES) for major muscles of the lower and upper extremities. The subjects were studied on two occasions receiving either melatonin (6 mg) or placebo (6 mg) in random order 60 min before each RES. Blood samples were taken from an antecubital vein both in fasting conditions in the morning and before RES (pre 60 min, pre 0 min), during RES (middle) and after RES (post 0 min, post 15 min, post 30 min, post 60 min). ... The serum melatonin concentration increased significantly (P<0.05-0.001) in the melatonin group following oral ingestion of melatonin and was elevated at every time point after that. The concentration reached a peak value of 1171.3+/-235.2 pg/mL in 60 min at pre 0. Serum melatonin increased slightly but significantly (P<0.05) also in the placebo group just before RES, in the middle of RES and after RES (post 0, post 15). There were large differences (P<0.01-0.001) in the serum melatonin concentration between the groups at all time points. ...",

The apparent elimination half-life of melatonin following an intravenous dose of 3 mg/kg (5 mg/kg in rats) was 19.8, 18.6, and 34.2 minutes, respectively, in rats, dogs, and monkeys. The dose normalized oral bioavailability of melatonin following a 10 mg/kg oral dose was 53.5% in rats, while it was in excess of 100% in dogs and monkeys. Further, bioavailability of melatonin following a 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal administration in rats was 74.0%, suggesting the lack of substantial first-pass hepatic extraction of melatonin in rats. However, the oral bioavailability of melatonin in dogs decreased to 16.9% following a 1 mg/kg oral dose, indicating dose-dependent bioavailability in dogs.",

MEL O-demethylation represents a minor reaction. The exact role of individual human cytochromes P450 (P450s) in these pathways has not been established. /The authors/ used a panel of 11 recombinant human P450 isozymes to investigate for the first time the 6-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of MEL. CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 all 6-hydroxylated MEL, with CYP2C19 playing a minor role. These reactions were NADPH-dependent. CYP2C19 and, to some extent CYP1A2, O-demethylated MEL. The K(m) (uM) and V(max) (k(cat), pmol/ min/ pmol P450) for 6-hydroxylation were estimated as 19.2 +/- 2.01 and 6.46 +/- 0.22 (CYP1A1), 25.9 +/- 2.47 and 10.6 +/- 0.32 (CYP1A2), and 30.9 +/- 3.76 and 5.31 +/- 0.21 (CYP1B1). These findings confirm the suggestion of others that CYP1A2 is probably the foremost hepatic P450 in the 6-hydroxylation of MEL and a single report that CYP1A1 is also able to mediate this reaction. However, this is the first time that CYP1B1 has been shown to 6-hydroxylate MEL. The IC50 for the CYP1B1-selective inhibitor (E)-2,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene was estimated to be 30 nM for MEL 6-hydroxylation by recombinant human CYP1B1. Comparison of brain homogenates from wild-type and cyp1b1-null mice revealed that MEL 6-hydroxylation was clearly mediated to a significant degree by CYP1B1. CYP1B1 is not expressed in the liver but has a ubiquitous extrahepatic distribution, and is found at high levels in tissues that also accumulate either MEL or 6-HMEL, such as intestine and cerebral cortex, where it may assist in regulating levels of MEL and 6-HMEL.",

During the day, plasma melatonin levels are low; at night, they rise 10 to 100-fold  or more in young adults, but by considerably less in older people- who often may have frequent nocturnal awakenings as a consequence. Very small oral doses of melatonin raise daytime plasma melatonin to night-time levels, thus making it easier for people to fall asleep in the afternoon or evening. Such doses can also help older people remain asleep during the night. Melatonin has also occasionally been claimed to confer other medical benefits e.g. preventing such age-related diseases as atherosclerosis, cancer, and alzheimer's disease.

It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes. MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes. The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.",

The physiological actions of melatonin are mainly mediated by melatonin receptors. /The authors/ describe the distribution of the melatonin receptor MT1 in the human hypothalamus and pituitary by immunocytochemistry. MT1 immunoreactivity showed a widespread pattern in the hypothalamus. In addition to the area of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a number of novel sites, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), periventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus (SON), sexually dimorphic nucleus, the diagonal band of Broca, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, infundibular nucleus, ventromedial and dorsomedial nucleus, tuberomamillary nucleus, mamillary body, and paraventricular thalamic nucleus were observed to have neuronal MT1 receptor expression. No staining was observed in the nucleus tuberalis lateralis and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The MT1 receptor was colocalized with some vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the SCN, colocalized with some parvocellular and magnocellular AVP and oxytocine (OXT) neurons in the PVN and SON, and colocalized with some parvocellular corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the PVN. In the pituitary, strong MT1 expression was observed in the pars tuberalis, while a weak staining was found in the posterior and anterior pituitary. These findings provide a neurobiological basis for the participation of melatonin in the regulation of various hypothalamic and pituitary functions. The colocalization of MT1 and CRH suggests that melatonin might directly modulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in the PVN, which may have implications for stress conditions such as depression.",

                      "String": "A major mechanism through which melatonin reduces the development of breast cancer is based on its anti-estrogenic actions by interfering at different levels with the estrogen-signalling pathways. Melatonin inhibits both aromatase activity and expression in vitro (MCF-7 cells) as well as in vivo, thus behaving as a selective estrogen enzyme modulator. The objective of this study was to study the effect of MT1 melatonin receptor overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells on the aromatase-suppressive effects of melatonin. Transfection of the MT1 melatonin receptor in MCF-7 cells significantly decreased aromatase activity of the cells and MT1-transfected cells showed a level of aromatase activity that was 50% of vector-transfected MCF-7 cells. The proliferation of estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 cells in an estradiol-free media but in the presence of testosterone (an indirect measure of aromatase activity) was strongly inhibited by melatonin in those cells overexpressing the MT1 receptor. This inhibitory effect of melatonin on cell growth was higher on MT1 transfected cells than in vector transfected ones. In MT1-transfected cells, aromatase activity (measured by the tritiated water release assay) was inhibited by melatonin (20% at 1 nM; 40% at 10 microM concentrations). The same concentrations of melatonin did not significantly influence the aromatase activity of vector-transfected cells. MT1 melatonin receptor transfection also induced a significant 55% inhibition of aromatase steady-state mRNA expression in comparison to vector-transfected MCF-7 cells (p<0.001). In addition, in MT1-transfected cells melatonin treatment inhibited aromatase mRNA expression and 1 nM melatonin induced a higher and significant down-regulation of aromatase mRNA expression (p<0.05) than in vector-transfected cells. The findings presented herein point to the importance of MT1 melatonin receptor in mediating the oncostatic action of melatonin in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and confirm MT1 melatonin receptor as a major mediator in the melatonin signalling pathway in breast cancer.",

The tryptophan is first 5-hydroxylated (by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase) and then decarboxylated (by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid  decarboxylase) to form 5-hydroxytryptamine or serotonin. During daylight hours, the serotonin in pinealocytes tends to be stored, and is unavailable to enzymes (monoamine oxidase and the melatonin-forming enzymes) that would otherwise act on it. With the onset of darkness, postganglionic sympathetic outflow to the pineal increases, and the consequent release of norepinephrine onto pinealocytes causes stored serotonin to become accessible for intracellular metabolism. At the same time, the norepinephrine activates the enzymes (especially serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), but also hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT)) that convert serotonin to melatonin. Consequently, pineal melatonin levels rises manifold. ... The melatonin then diffuses out of the pineal gland into the blood stream and cerebrospinal fluid, rapidly raising human plasma melatonin levels from about 2-10 to 100-200 pg/mL.",

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight variation, disintegration (not applicable for controlled-release products), and drug dissolution, based on USP standards. Twelve-hour dissolution profiles were obtained from the controlled-release products. All tablets were also evaluated for friability following the USP procedure and for hardness following unofficial procedures. RESULTS: All products passed the weight variation test. Two products showed excessive friability. Three immediate-release products failed both the disintegration and the dissolution tests. One of the three products demonstrated a threefold difference in hardness. One controlled-release product released 90% of melatonin in four hours in the dissolution test; the other released 90% of its content in 12 hours. ... Some products showed evidence of poor formulation and/or poor quality control as indicated by excessive friability, failure to disintegrate and dissolve, and excessive variation in hardness. In vitro release profiles of the two controlled-release products were substantially different. The poor quality of some supplements should be a concern to consumers and health care providers.",

The most common side effects, day-time drowsiness, headache and dizziness, appear to occur at the same frequency as with placebo. Other reported side effects include transient depressive symptoms, mild tremor, mild anxiety, abdominal cramps, irritability, reduced alertness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. Safety in Adults: Evidence indicates that it is likely safe to use in oral and parenteral forms for up to two months when used appropriately. Some evidence indicates that it can be safely used orally for up to 9 months in some patients. It is also likely safe to use topically when used appropriately. Safety in Children: Melatonin appeared to be used safely in small numbers of children enrolled in short-term clinical trials. However, concerns regarding safety in children have arisen based on their developmental state. Compared to adults over 20 years of age, people under 20 produce high levels of melatonin. Melatonin levels are inversely related to gonadal development and it is thought that exogenous administration of melatonin may adversely affect gonadal development. Safety during Pregnancy: High doses of melatonin administered orally or parenterally may inhibit ovulation. Not advised for use in individuals who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Safety during Lactation: Not recommended as safety has not be established. Oral, rat: LD50 ≥3200 mg/kg",

Dose-response curves were determined by probit analysis. RESULTS: Melatonin premedication decreased thiopental ED50 values for loss of response to verbal command and eyelash reflex from 3.4 mg/kg (95% confidence interval, 3.2-3.5 mg/kg) and 3.7 mg/kg (3.5-3.9 mg/kg) to 2.7 mg/kg (2.6-2.9 mg/kg) and 2.6 mg/kg (2.5-2.7 mg/kg), respectively (P < 0.05). Corresponding propofol ED50 values decreased from 1.5 mg/kg (1.4-1.6 mg/kg) and 1.6 mg/kg (1.5-1.7 mg/kg) to 0.9 mg/kg (0.8-0.96 mg/kg) and 0.9 mg/kg (0.8-0.95 mg/kg), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin premedication significantly decreased the doses of both propofol and thiopental required to induce anesthesia.",

Three groups of animals were used in this study (control, lead acetate-treated (100 mg/kg), and lead acetate plus melatonin (10 mg/kg) for 30 days. Levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total glutathione (GSH), histopathological changes in the liver and kidneys were investigated. In addition, nuclear area (NA), nuclear volume (NV) and the ratio of nuclear volume/cellular volume (N/C) were measured in the liver. The results revealed increased LPO and decreased SOD, GSH, NA, NV and N/C in the studied organs of lead-treated rats. Histopathological observations showed severe damage in the liver and kidneys. Melatonin co-treatment to the lead-administered rats attenuated the increase of LPO and restored the activity of SOD and levels of GSH as well as the mean values of NA, NV and N/C. Also, the morphological damage in the liver and kidneys was reduced and the tissues appeared like those of controls. The present study suggests that melatonin may be useful in combating free radical-induced damage due to lead toxicity.",

Cardiac function was improved and lipid peroxidation decreased after melatonin treatment. It is concluded that melatonin provides protection against doxorubicin toxicity via an attenuation of lipid peroxidation.",

A pilot study of 3 adult males showed dose linearity, absence of saturation kinetics, and unaltered metabolism and urinary excretion for doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0 ug/kg. All other subjects received 0.5 ug/kg melatonin. The results of pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from serum melatonin showed no significant gender differences in adults. However, developmental differences were significant between prepubertal children and adults for terminal elimination rate constant (1.08 +/- 0.25 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.11 per hr), elimination half-life (0.67 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.10 hr), and area under the concentration-time curve (250.9 +/- 91.8 vs. 376.9 +/- 154.3 (pg/mL)hr, respectively). At all time points melatonin levels were higher in serum than in saliva, and the ratio between serum and salivary melatonin varied up to 55-fold within and between individuals. Results based on salivary melatonin showed significant differences between prepubertal children and adults for the terminal elimination rate constant (1.90 +/- 0.95 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.28 per hr). The described group differences in pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that prepubertal children metabolize melatonin faster than adults. The inconsistent ratio between serum and salivary melatonin calls for caution in the use of salivary melatonin for pharmacokinetic studies or to infer pineal function. The present findings, suggestive of faster melatonin metabolism in prepubertal children, combined with the known decline of serum melatonin with age and higher excretion rate of the metabolite in prepubertal children lead us to conclude that the prepubertal pineal gland has a higher melatonin secretion rate than the adult gland.",

In addition, a pinealomectomized patient whose nocturnal plasma melatonin had been abolished was investigated after the i.v. infusion--once during the night and once during the day. The clearance of melatonin from blood showed a biexponential decay. The pharmacokinetic parameters in the two studies were similar, except for the disappearance rate constant beta and the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss). Supplementary peaks or troughs were superimposed on the plateau and the falling part of the profile. They were not due to stimulation of endogenous secretion, because they were also seen in the pinealomectomized patient. During the melatonin infusion, the plasma hormone level reached a steady-state after 60 and 120 min, and when it was equal to the nocturnal level.",

It has been found that experiments with DMH administration can be used as an animal model of female reproductive system premature aging. The investigation of epithalamine (a polypeptide preparation from the bovine pineal gland) effect on circadian rhythms disturbed by the neurotoxic compound DMH has shown a recovery of the diurnal dynamics of NE in MPA. In addition, NE was found to decrease from 9:30 till 11 o'clock, Circadian Time (CT), which was typical of control animals. Epitalon (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) proved to be more effective in ME-Arc. This peptide prevents the xenobiotic caused disturbance of DA diurnal rhythm, keeping this metabolite low at 5 o'clock (CT) with it having increased by 11 o'clock (CT). The data obtained suggest that the pineal gland is important for the circadian signal normalization needed for gonadoliberin surge on the day of proestrus. Melatonin and peptides of the pineal gland can be considered as effective protectors of female reproductive system from xenobiotics and premature aging.",

Following a single i.v. injection at 5 or 15 mg/kg, plasma concentrations of melatonin increased to 39 and 199 million pg/mL at 2 min and 128,000 and 772,000 pg/mL at 120 min. Within 60 min of injection, the blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature remained unaffected. Melatonin at 5 mg/kg did not influence the complete blood counts at 60 min, but melatonin at 15 mg/kg had some effects on the differential white cell and platelet counts. Melatonin at 5 or 15 mg/kg slightly elevated some liver enzymes at 60 min of injection, and melatonin at higher dose also elevated plasma creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase levels. At 24 hr after completion of six daily injections of melatonin, there was a 5.5% reduction in body weight. Gross postmortem examination and histological examination of the brain, kidney, liver and spleen did not reveal any evidence of toxicity. In conclusion, melatonin in propylene glycol markedly elevates plasma levels of melatonin with no serious toxicity. This preparation should be further evaluated in human patients.",

They were euthanazed three days after calving. The dietary supplements had no effect on the impression hardness or the concentrations of cysteine and methionine in samples of claw horn collected from a range of sites, or on the areas of erosion in the sole and heel. Significant differences were recorded for the hardness of the horn in the order wall >sole >heel. These differences were associated with higher concentrations of cysteine and lower concentrations of methionine in samples of horn from the dorsal wall than in samples from the prebulbar region of the sole. There were no significant differences attributable to the dietary supplements in the soft tissue anatomy of the solear dermis and epidermis.",

The developmental toxicity potential for repeated oral doses of MEL had not previously been evaluated. In the present studies, time-mated, Sprague-Dawley-derived (CD) rats were administered MEL or vehicle by gavage on gestation days (gd) 6-19. MEL-treated groups received 1-, 10-, 100-, 150-, or 200-mg/kg body weight/day in the screening study (15 rats/group), and 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day in the definitive study (25 rats/group). In both studies, maternal food/water consumption, body weight, and clinical signs were monitored at regular intervals throughout gestation. At termination (gd 20, both studies), maternal liver and gravid uterine weights, number of ovarian corpora lutea, conceptus survival, fetal sex, and fetal body weight were evaluated. Fetal morphological examination included external structures (both studies) as well as visceral and skeletal structures (definitive study). In the screening study, maternal serum levels of 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone were determined by radioimmunoassay, and mammary tissue was fixed, stained, and evaluated for percent glandular area within the fat pad. No maternal morbidity/mortality was found in either study. In the screening study, aversion to treatment (> or =100 mg/kg/day) and reduced maternal weight gain (> or =150 mg/kg/day) were noted, but reproductive/endocrine parameters and fetal development were not affected. In the definitive study, aversion to treatment was noted at > or =50 mg/kg/day, and mild sedation, reduced maternal food intake, and reduced body weight gain were found during initial treatment with 200 mg/kg/day. MEL had no effect on prenatal survival, fetal body weight, or incidences of fetal malformations/variations. Thus, in the definitive study, the maternal toxicity NOAEL and LOAEL were 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the developmental toxicity NOAEL was > or =200 mg/kg/day.",

                          "String": "Melatonin's production and use in drugs and dietary supplements may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Melatonin is a substance found in the pineal gland of animals and humans. It occurs in many plants including feverfew, St John's wort, rice, corn, tomato and edible fruits such as cherries, bananas and grapes. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.4X10-7 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates melatonin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase melatonin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 2 hours. Particulate-phase melatonin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Melatonin absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, melatonin is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 904. Melatonin has pKa values of 16.51 and -0.69 and is uncharged in the entire pH-range; therefore, sorption in soil will be determined by the neutral form of melatonin. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. Melatonin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A strain of bacterium (Shewanella putrefaciens) isolated from an estuarine wetland sediment was able to use melatonin as a sole source of carbon and energy under aerobic conditions and completely degrade melatonin at initial concentrations of 25-150 mg/L within a 144-hr incubation period. If released into water, melatonin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to melatonin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where melatonin is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to melatonin via ingestion of foods or dietary supplements containing this compound. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase melatonin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase melatonin may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Melatonin absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm(3,4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Melatonin in both fluids was beyond the limit of detection during the day, whereas during the night, its concentration was 280 pmol/L in serum and 99 pmol/L in milk. Six mothers collected milk after each feeding throughout 1 24-h period within 3 months after delivery. Melatonin in the milk of all subjects exhibited a pronounced daily rhythm, with high levels during the night and undetectable levels during the day. The presence of the rhythm in milk suggests that melatonin fluctuations in milk might communicate time of day information to breast-fed infants.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
